title: New Theme, New Start

This is a new theme for my blog. I've been using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator for a while, and
I've been using the [Even](https://github.com/olOwOlo/hugo-theme-even) theme for a while. But it feels a little weird to
use a theme that is not my own and not updated for a long time. So I decided to fork some simple themes and make my own
updates.

The theme I'm currently using is based on the [Hugo Bootstrap 5](https://github.com/NotWoods/hugo-bootstrap-5) theme. I
made some changes to the theme to make it more suitable for my blog. I also upgraded the Bootstrap version to use the
latest.
