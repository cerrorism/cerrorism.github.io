I'm a software engineer working in the Bay Area. I'm currently working on developing backend services with Kotlin and
Spring Boot. I'd like to use the right tool for the job, and I'm always looking for new technologies to learn.

I'm interested in the DSL created by the [Kotlin language](https://kotlinlang.org/), and I'm currently seeking for more
interesting topics around it.

In day-to-day life, I provide technical suggestions and solutions for AWS infrastructure. I'm currently certified as AWS
Certified Solution Architect - Professional.
